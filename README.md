# Vole Machine Simulator

## Project Overview
The **Vole Machine Simulator** is a software application that simulates the operation of a simplified computer model known as the Vole Machine. This educational tool is designed to help users learn and understand fundamental concepts of computer architecture and machine-level programming. The project is implemented using **C++** with a **Qt-based GUI** for an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Description
The **Vole Machine** is a conceptual computing system used to teach basic principles of computer science. It includes core components such as the **CPU**, **memory**, and **registers**, and allows for the execution of machine-level instructions. The simulator enables users to observe how these components interact during program execution, providing a hands-on approach to understanding processes like instruction fetching, decoding, and execution.

## Download and Installation
To download the **Vole Machine Simulator** executable:
- Go to the **VoleMachineGUI** branch.
- Download the **release.zip** file.
- Unzip the file and run **VoleMachine.exe**. That's all!
