# Vole Machine Simulator

## Project Overview

> The **Vole Machine Simulator** is a software application that simulates the operation of a simplified computer model known as the Vole Machine. This educational tool is designed
> to help users learn and understand fundamental concepts of computer architecture and machine-level programming. The project is implemented using C++ with a Qt-based GUI for an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Description

> The **Vole Machine** is a conceptual computing system used to teach basic principles of computer science. It includes core components such as the **CPU**, **memory**, and
> **registers**, and allows for the execution of machine-level instructions. The simulator enables users to observe how these components interact during program execution, providing a hands-on
> approach to understanding processes like instruction fetching, decoding, and execution.

## Download and Installation
> Download and Installation
> To download the Vole Machine Simulator executable, go to the **VoleMachineGUI branch** and download the **release.zip** file. Unzip the file and run **VoleMachine.exe**
> and that's all.
