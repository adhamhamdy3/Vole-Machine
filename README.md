# Vole Machine Simulator

## Project Overview
The **Vole Machine Simulator** is a software application that simulates the operation of a simplified computer model known as the Vole Machine. This educational tool is designed to help users learn and understand fundamental concepts of computer architecture and machine-level programming. The project is implemented using **C++** with a **Qt-based GUI** for an intuitive and interactive user experience.

## Description
The **Vole Machine** is a conceptual computing system used to teach basic principles of computer science. It includes core components such as the **CPU**, **memory**, and **registers**, and allows for the execution of machine-level instructions. The simulator enables users to observe how these components interact during program execution, providing a hands-on approach to understanding processes like instruction fetching, decoding, and execution.

## Features
- **Memory Initialization**: By default, memory starts with `0A` (hexadecimal) at all addresses.
- **Program Counter View**: The **Program Counter** can switch between **hexadecimal** and **integer** views for easy examination of its value.
- **Help Button**: Provides the full instruction set and explains the color coding used in the application for memory and registers.
- **Instructions/sec Section**:
  - Controlled by **Play**/**Stop** buttons.
  - Adjustable value for the number of instructions per second to control execution speed.
- **Screen Modes**:
  - Switch between **ASCII** and **Hexadecimal** modes to preview screen output.

## Download and Give
To download the latest release of the **Vole Machine Simulator**, visit the [Release page]([https://github.com/your-username/your-repository/releases](https://github.com/adhamhamdy3/Vole-Machine/releases/tag/v1.1)) on GitHub and download the `release.zip` file. Unzip the file and run **Vole-Machine.exe**.

## Testing
You can test the application using this instruction set: **2000 2130 2201 23C6 2420 3100 3400 5112 3101 5113 B124 1101 B014 C000**
This set will print the numbers from 0 to 9 on the screen.
